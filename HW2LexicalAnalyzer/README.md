Homework #2 - Lexical Analyzer


Implementation of a lexical analyzer for the programming language PL/0.


- To compile: gcc lex.c driver.c (the files lex.c, driver.c, & compiler.h are in the current directory) OR run the Makefile with command "make". Makefile runs the command "gcc driver.c lex.c"  
  
- To execute: ./a.out filename.txt where the files in the command line are in the current directory.
                       
- To run shell script for testing: ./name.sh (in this case ./tester.sh)
